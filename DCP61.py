# This problem was asked by Google.

# Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.

# Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

# For example, pow(2, 10) should return 1024.


class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        elif n < 0:
            return 1 / self.myPow(x, -n)
        elif n % 2 != 0:
            return x * self.myPow(x, n - 1)
        else:
            return self.myPow(x * x, n / 2)
